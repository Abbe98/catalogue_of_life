SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
====================
PHP  
  Required version: 5.2.10+

  * Extensions:
    ctype   (http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.ctype.php)
    json    (http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.json.php)
    mysqli  (http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mysqli.php)

Apache
  Required version: 2.0+

  * Modules:
    mod_rewrite (http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_rewrite.html)
    

INSTALLATION
=============
1. Setup the database by executing the following lines in the Terminal

	$ mysql -u root -e 'CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS col2015ac';
	$ tar zxvf col2015ac.sql.tar.gz
	$ mysql -u root col2015ac < col2015ac.sql	

	Use the following command to remove the uncompressed SQL file:
	
	$ rm col2015ac.sql

2. Deploy the application

   Uncompress col2015ac_application.tar.gz file and copy the extracted col2015ac 
   directory into the root folder of the web server.

3. Set up permissions

   Create folder col2015ac/application/cache
   The web server has to have read access to all the files and read-write 
   access to the following folders:

   col2015ac/application/cache --> Cached query results are stored here.
   col2015ac/application/log   --> Any error that may occur is logged here
   
   Example (assuming that the web server user:group is www-data:www-data): 
   
   $ chown -R www-data:www-data col2015ac
   $ chmod -R 777 col2015ac

4. Configure the application

   Edit the file col2015ac/application/configs/config.ini to set the 
   database connection paramters and the Google Analytics tracker id (if any, 
   otherwise leave it empty):

   [standalone]
   # Database
   database.params.port     = 3306
   database.params.host     = localhost
   database.params.username = here-your-MySQL-username
   database.params.password = here-your-MySQL-password
   database.params.dbname   = here-the-name-of-the-db (col2015ac in the example 
                              above)
   Remember that the database name is case sensitive. (col2015ac is NOT CoL2015AC)
5. Configure Apache

       5.1. Make sure that the rewrite module is enabled.
            $ (sudo) a2enmod rewrite

       5.2. Create an alias inside the Apache VirtualHost in port 80 that points 
            to the *public* folder of the application.
   
       Example:
   
               Alias /col2015ac "/col2015ac/public/"
               <Directory "/col2015ac/public/">
                   Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
                   AllowOverride FileInfo Options
                   Order allow,deny
                   Allow from all
               </Directory>

       Remember that the file system in Linux is case sensitive (col2015ac is NOT CoL2015AC).

       Finally, restart Apache to have the changes applied. 
   
   NOTE: If the application does not load as expected, checking the Apache logs 
   may help to identify the problem (the Apache 2 error log file is typically 
   located in /var/log/apache2/error.log).
